# UI Rules

TimeTracker is an operational desktop/web app. Build interfaces for scanning, repeated daily entry, correction, and review.

## Product Feel

- Quiet, utilitarian, and work-focused.
- Dense but organized.
- Clear hierarchy without marketing-style hero sections.
- No decorative gradients, blobs, or purely atmospheric visuals.
- Avoid nested cards and page sections styled as floating cards.

## Layout

- Prefer full-width app surfaces with constrained inner content where needed.
- Use cards only for repeated items, dialogs, and genuinely framed tools.
- Keep fixed-format elements stable with explicit width, height, grid tracks, or aspect ratios.
- Do not let hover states, badges, loading text, or dynamic labels resize the layout.
- Ensure mobile and desktop text never overlaps controls or adjacent content.

## Components

- Use existing `apps/web/src/components/ui` primitives before creating new primitives.
- Use `apps/web/src/components/app-surface.tsx` for repeated product surfaces:
  - `AppPanel` for settings-style app panels.
  - `MessagePanel` for status, empty, and warning messages.
  - `SurfaceCallout` for icon/title/body callouts.
- Use `Checkbox` from `apps/web/src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx` for checkbox controls. Do not add new raw `type="checkbox"` controls in feature code.
- Feature pages should not directly reference `settings-panel` or `message-panel`; those classes are owned by the app-surface module.
- Use Remix icons already present in the app for icon buttons and navigation.
- Use icon-only buttons for common commands when the icon is familiar and an accessible label is provided.
- Use tooltips for compact or unfamiliar icon controls.
- Use segmented controls, toggles, selects, tabs, popovers, dialogs, and menus according to their existing local patterns.

## Typography

- Use compact headings inside panels, cards, sidebars, and toolbars.
- Reserve large display type for true page-level emphasis, which should be rare in this app.
- Do not scale font size with viewport width.
- Keep letter spacing at `0` unless an existing style already requires otherwise.

## Color

- Use semantic CSS variables from `agents/ui-tokens.md`.
- Avoid one-note palettes dominated by a single hue.
- Use status color only where it communicates state or risk.

## Interaction

- Keep the fastest path for daily time entry visible and reachable.
- Make destructive actions explicit and reversible where practical.
- Connector sync and import actions must communicate side effects.
- Preserve user-entered values during validation errors.

## Accessibility

- Every interactive icon needs an accessible name.
- Form errors should be near the field they describe.
- Keyboard focus must remain visible.
- Dialogs and popovers should have predictable open, close, and submit behavior.
